## Check out the [Demo](http://novalain.github.io/SPH-Fluid-WebGL/)

Just playing around in WebGL with our old project that was originally made in C++/OpenGL. The Navier-Stokes equations were just rewritten into Javascript with three.js, No optimizations at all, 100% brute force calculations atm.

## Installation

Copy repository, navigate to root folder and run

```
npm install
grunt serve
```

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/RiiQQe/Modelleringsprojekt.git).
